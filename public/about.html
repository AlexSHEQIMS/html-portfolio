<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am the Operations Manager at SHEQ-IMS (Pty) Ltd, where I oversee all operational aspects of the company. 
  With a focus on quality management systems, I specialize in ISO 9001, 14001, and 45001 standards, 
  providing expert implementation, maintenance, and auditing services for our clients.</p>

<p>Recently, I have embarked on a journey to expand my skill set by delving into software development. 
  This new venture aligns with my goal to innovate within the ISO industry, 
  as I aim to create a web application that streamline processes and enhance efficiency for our clientele</p>
